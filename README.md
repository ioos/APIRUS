# apirus
A repo for discussion of an API for Regular, Unstructured and Staggered model output  (or API R US :smile_cat:)

This repo is mostly for discussion of a common python API for working with Regular structured Grids ([CF Conventions](http://cfconventions.org/)), Unstructured Grids (CF + [UGRID Conventions](https://github.com/ugrid-conventions/ugrid-conventions/blob/master/README.md)), and Staggered Grids (CF + [SGRID Conventions](https://publicwiki.deltares.nl/display/NETCDF/Deltares+proposal+for+Staggered+Grid+data+model))
