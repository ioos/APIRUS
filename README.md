# APIRUS
A repo for discussing an **API** for **R**egular, **U**nstructured and **S**taggered model output  (or "**API-R-US**" :smile_cat:)

* Regular structured Grids ([CF Conventions](http://cfconventions.org/)), with API embedded in [Iris](http://scitools.org.uk/iris/) and to some degree in [Xray](https://github.com/xray/xray)
* Unstructured Grids (CF + [UGRID Conventions](https://github.com/ugrid-conventions/ugrid-conventions/blob/master/README.md)), with nascent API in [pyugrid](https://github.com/pyugrid/pyugrid)
* Staggered Grids (CF + [SGRID Conventions](https://publicwiki.deltares.nl/display/NETCDF/Deltares+proposal+for+Staggered+Grid+data+model)) with nascent API in [pysgrid](https://github.com/sgrid/pysgrid)
